Project Name: Student Grade Calculator

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT: 

Objective:
The Student Grade Tracker program is designed to help students and educators manage academic performance by tracking grades for various subjects or assignments. The program provides an easy way to input grades, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade and GPA (Grade Point Average). This program serves as an efficient tool for monitoring academic progress and understanding performance metrics.

Key Features:
Input Grades:
o	The program allows users (students or educators) to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
o	Grades are entered as numeric values (between 0 and 100). Users can enter as many grades as needed.
o	The program includes input validation to ensure that only valid grades (numeric values between 0 and 100) are entered.

Average Grade Calculation:
o	The program automatically calculates the average of all the grades entered.
o	This average serves as an overall measure of the student’s performance across all assignments or subjects.

Letter Grade Determination:
o	Based on the calculated average, the program determines the letter grade according to a standard grading scale:
	A: 90-100
	B: 80-89
	C: 70-79
	D: 60-69
	F: Below 60
o	This provides an easy-to-understand representation of a student's performance.

GPA Calculation:
o	The program calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on a 4.0 scale:
	4.0 for grades between 90-100 (A)
	3.0 for grades between 80-89 (B)
	2.0 for grades between 70-79 (C)
	1.0 for grades between 60-69 (D)
	0.0 for grades below 60 (F)
o	The GPA is calculated based on the average grade, providing a more detailed academic performance indicator.

Grade Summary Output:
o	After the grades are entered and processed, the program displays a summary:
	The list of grades entered.
	The calculated average grade.
	The corresponding letter grade.
	The calculated GPA.

User-friendly Interface:
o	The program provides clear instructions and prompts for the user, making it easy to enter grades.
o	Users can type "done" to finish entering grades.
o	The results are displayed in a well-formatted manner, making the output easily understandable.

Input Validation:
o	The program ensures that all grades entered are valid (numeric values between 0 and 100).
o	Invalid inputs prompt the user to re-enter the grade.
